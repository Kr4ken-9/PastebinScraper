Don't know if scraper is the correct term, but it does its job. 
Also, I do not guarantee quality. 
Furthermore, this was made for a very specific use-case. I made it to download 154 images from a pastebin of pure image links. It can be repurposed with a little elbow grease but otherwise it's just on github as a backup.
